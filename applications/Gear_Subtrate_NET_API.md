## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Unity .NET API for Substrate-based blockchains is a programming interface that enables developers to interact with Substrate-based blockchains using the Unity game engine. The Unity .NET API provides a set of functional capabilities that simplify the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on Substrate-based blockchains.

### Overview

The functional capabilities of Unity .NET API for Substrate-based blockchains include:

1. Blockchain Interaction: The API enables developers to interact with the blockchain by querying and submitting transactions. Developers can retrieve information such as account balances, transaction status, and block data using the API.

2. Account Management: The Unity .NET API provides functionality to manage user accounts, including the ability to create, import, and export account keys. Developers can use the API to manage account balances, initiate transactions, and track transaction history.

3. Event Handling: The Unity .NET API provides an event-based system to handle events generated by the Substrate-based blockchain, such as block confirmation, transaction status changes, and contract events. Developers can use the API to trigger custom events based on blockchain events.

4. Smart Contract Integration: The API provides integration with Substrate-based smart contracts, allowing developers to interact with smart contracts using Unity game engine. Developers can use the API to deploy, call, and manage smart contracts.

5. Testnet Integration: The Unity .NET API includes support for testnet integration, enabling developers to test their dApps in a safe environment before deploying them to the mainnet.

6. Security: The API provides secure communication with the blockchain by encrypting data and transactions. Developers can use the API to encrypt and decrypt data, sign and verify transactions, and secure user accounts.

### Project Details

TBD...

> :exclamation: We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

> :exclamation: Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Overall, the Unity .NET API for Substrate-based blockchains provides a set of functional capabilities that make it easier for developers to build dApps using the Unity game engine in the entire Dotsama ecosystem. 

The first network powered by Gear Protocol is the [Vara Network](https://vara-network.io/). It is the fast and reliable on-ramp for the next iteration of gaming projects. Gear team will extend the proposed API with Gear Protocol's specific, so anyone can easily create Unity games that interact with Gear-powered netowrks.

A couple of years ago, Ajuna Network attempted to implement similar API - [Ajuna.NetApi](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.NetApi). The differences with the proposed project are as follows:

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: - TBD

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** _Duration of the whole project_ - 2 months ???
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  _Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)_ - 1 FTE ???
- **Total Costs:** _Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment._ - ???

## Future Plans

Anyone can use the proposed solution to integrate their Unity-based applciation into Substrate blockchains.

Furhter, we plan to implement an extension of the Unity API considering Gear specifics - Actor model for message communications etc.
