## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

.NET API for Substrate-based blockchains is a programming interface that enables .NET applications to interact with smart contracts running on blockchains built on Substrate. The .NET API provides a set of functional capabilities that simplify the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and allow them to utilize the technology of Substrate-based blockchains.

### Overview

The functional capabilities of .NET API for Substrate-based blockchains include:

1. Smart Contract Integration: The API enables developers to integrate with smart contracts by providing functionality to deploy, call, and manage contracts. Developers can use the API to interact with smart contracts using the .NET framework.

2. Account Management: The API provides functionality to manage user accounts, including the ability to create, import, and export account keys. Developers can use the API to manage account balances, initiate transactions, and track transaction history.

3. Event Handling: The API provides an event-based system to handle events generated by the Substrate-based blockchain, such as block confirmation, transaction status changes, and contract events. Developers can use the API to trigger custom events based on blockchain events.

4. Transaction Management: The API enables developers to create and sign transactions, manage transaction queues, and track transaction status. Developers can use the API to ensure secure communication with the blockchain by encrypting data and transactions.

5. Testnet Integration: The API includes support for testnet integration, enabling developers to test their dApps in a safe environment before deploying them to the mainnet.

6. Security: The API provides secure communication with the blockchain by encrypting data and transactions. Developers can use the API to encrypt and decrypt data, sign and verify transactions, and secure user accounts.

### Project Details

1. We will produce a set of .NET APIs using lower level abstractions for general interation with any Substrate-based network:
   1. General .NET API for interacting with any Substrate-based network. It will be a library carrying over JSON RPC calls and listening to events from the node. There are already a number of such implementations, for example - [Ajuna.NetApi](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.NetApi). In our implementation, we will suggest a better Type system (although it could be quite subjective).
    2. A separate .NET library implementing Parity SCALE codec. Apparently there is no any at the moment. Such a libary can be used by any other one exposing their custom API surface for working with Substrate based network bypassing
  the library described in p 1.1. The codec can be used for any other communications not necessary related to blockchain.

2. The general implementation from p. 1 will be used to implement a .NET API for interacting with a Gear node in terms of the Gear's protocol concepts like
    1. Programs and their communications via send and reply messages
    2. Mailboxes, Gas reservations, etc

3. We can consider implementing something special for being listed on the Unity Asset Store, additional investigation is required.

### Ecosystem Fit

Overall, the API for implementing .NET applications that interact with smart contracts on Substrate-based blockchains provides a set of functional capabilities that make it easier for developers to build dApps using the .NET framework.

The first network powered by Gear Protocol is the [Vara Network](https://vara-network.io/). It is the fast and reliable on-ramp for the next iteration of gaming projects. Gear team will extend the proposed API with Gear Protocol's specific, so anyone can easily create Unity games and other .NET applications that interact with programs running on Gear-powered netowrks.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: - TBD

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** _Duration of the whole project_ - 2 months ???
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  _Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)_ - 1 FTE ???
- **Total Costs:** _Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment._ - ???

## Future Plans

Anyone can use the proposed solution to integrate their .NET applciations into Substrate blockchains.

Furhter plans to implement a dApp examples that utilize .NET API considering Gear specifics - Actor model for message communications etc.
