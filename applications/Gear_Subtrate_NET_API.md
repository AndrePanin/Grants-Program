## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

.NET API for Substrate-based blockchains is a programming interface that enables .NET applications to interact with smart contracts running on blockchains built on Substrate. The .NET API provides a set of functional capabilities that simplify the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and allow them to utilize the technology of Substrate-based blockchains.

### Overview

The functional capabilities of .NET API for Substrate-based blockchains include:

1. Smart Contract Integration: The API enables developers to integrate with smart contracts by providing functionality to deploy, call, and manage contracts. Developers can use the API to interact with smart contracts using the .NET framework.

2. Account Management: The API provides functionality to manage user accounts, including the ability to create, import, and export account keys. Developers can use the API to manage account balances, initiate transactions, and track transaction history.

3. Event Handling: The API provides an event-based system to handle events generated by the Substrate-based blockchain, such as block confirmation, transaction status changes, and contract events. Developers can use the API to trigger custom events based on blockchain events.

4. Transaction Management: The API enables developers to create and sign transactions, manage transaction queues, and track transaction status. Developers can use the API to ensure secure communication with the blockchain by encrypting data and transactions.

5. Testnet Integration: The API includes support for testnet integration, enabling developers to test their dApps in a safe environment before deploying them to the mainnet.

6. Security: The API provides secure communication with the blockchain by encrypting data and transactions. Developers can use the API to encrypt and decrypt data, sign and verify transactions, and secure user accounts.

### Project Details

1. We will produce a set of .NET APIs using lower level abstractions for general interation with any Substrate-based network:
   1. General .NET API for interacting with any Substrate-based network. It will be a library carrying over JSON RPC calls and listening to events from the node. There are already a number of such implementations, for example - [Ajuna.NetApi](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.NetApi). In our implementation, we will suggest a better Type system (although it could be quite subjective).
    2. A separate .NET library implementing Parity SCALE codec. Apparently there is no any at the moment. Such a libary can be used by any other one exposing their custom API surface for working with Substrate based network bypassing
  the library described in p 1.1. The codec can be used for any other communications not necessary related to blockchain.

2. The general implementation from p. 1 will be used to implement a .NET API for interacting with a Gear node in terms of the Gear's protocol concepts like
    1. Programs and their communications via send and reply messages
    2. Mailboxes, Gas reservations, etc

3. We can consider implementing something special for being listed on the Unity Asset Store, additional investigation is required.

### Ecosystem Fit

Overall, the API for implementing .NET applications that interact with smart contracts on Substrate-based blockchains provides a set of functional capabilities that make it easier for developers to build dApps using the .NET framework.

The first network powered by Gear Protocol is the [Vara Network](https://vara-network.io/). It is the fast and reliable on-ramp for the next iteration of gaming projects. Gear team will extend the proposed API with Gear Protocol's specific, so anyone can easily create Unity games and other .NET applications that interact with programs running on Gear-powered netowrks.

| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate/Gear nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| **0e.** | Article | We will publish an **article** on Medium that explains what was done/achieved as part of the grant. |
| **1.** | Library: .NET-scale-codec | We will deliver a .NET library that will implement SCALE codec to encode and decode data. |
| **2.** | Library: .NET-Substrate | We will deliver a .NET library that will work with arbitrary Substrate node using library from #1 |
| **3.** | Library: .NET-Gear | We will deliver a .NET library that will work with Gear node in its terms. |

## Future Plans

Anyone can use the proposed solution to integrate their .NET applciations into Substrate blockchains.

Furhter plans to implement a dApp examples that utilize .NET API considering Gear specifics - Actor model for message communications etc.
